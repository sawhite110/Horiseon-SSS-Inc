##Code Refactor:

*In this repo is a Code Refactor exercise, where I will be updating the code in the index.html and styles.css files, to meet the customers needs.

*A marketing agency is hiring me to update thier website to follow the current accessibility standards and optimize it for search engine optimization.

*I will be commenting into both index.html and styles.css files to keep a tab on the updates that I make during the process and to also allow anyone who comes in behind me, to be able to follow my process and make their own changes.

*When the sorce code is viewed in develpoer tools in the browser, the code will be rendered using the semantic HTML structure with accessibility standards.

*The CSS code in the styles.css folder has been consolidated and organized to follow the semantic structure, so you can see what redundancy code was taken out.

*Here you can find a link my screenshots of when I pushed my commits to GitHub.com:
